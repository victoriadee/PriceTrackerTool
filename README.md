PriceTrackerTool
I've created a comprehensive Price Tracker Tool designed specifically for retail shopkeepers in informal markets. The application helps users track and compare supplier prices to make smarter purchasing decisions.

The tool features a modern, responsive interface with a cohesive color system centered around deep blue and teal accents. The dashboard provides quick access to key metrics and price drop opportunities, while dedicated sections for supplier management, product catalogs, price tracking, and comparison make it easy to organize and analyze pricing data.

The application is built with React and TypeScript using modular components for maintainability and scalability. All data is currently stored in memory using React context, which would be replaced with a proper backend database in a production environment.

Core Features:

Supplier management (add, edit, delete suppliers)
Product catalog with categories
Price tracking with history visualization
Price comparison across multiple suppliers
Quick price update functionality
Data export for reporting
Search and filter capabilities
Notifications for significant price changes
Design Elements:

Professional retail-focused interface with a clean, organized layout
Color system with deep blue primary (#1E40AF), teal accent (#0D9488), with complementary success, warning, and error states
Subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience
Responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
Card-based UI with clear visual hierarchy and intentional white space
Data visualization with easy-to-read charts for price trends
Consistent 8px spacing system with proper alignment
